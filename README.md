# [mHelp (DynHelp)](https://github.com/STUDIO-Artaban/mHelp)
**mHelp** is a Windows **SDK** that easily includes to your applications a dynamic help and an evolutive macros system.

This project, previously called **DynHelp SDK**, started during the 1999 year and is based on a simple concept: everything a user can do on the UI of an application can be done programmatically.

This **SDK** comes in the form of a DLL that exports two common functions:

* **mHelpInit**<br>
Called when the main window of your application is activated.
* **mHelpOpen**<br>
Called at a menu or button activation from the main window of your application to open the **mHelp** window.

Its operating principle is related to the UI management under Windows via a message loop. Indeed, by using the code line below it is possible to redirect this message loop in order to catch every events generated by the user when he acts on the UI (see [mHelp.cpp](https://github.com/STUDIO-Artaban/mHelp/blob/master/mHelp/mHelp.cpp) at line 148).

```c++
MainCell=new CWndCell(hNewWnd,SetWindowLongPtr(hNewWnd,GWLP_WNDPROC,NewProc));
```

Like this, during a macro creation, it is possible to identify on which UI control the user has acted, and to save it into a file. File that will be read in order to reproduce what the user has done, when a macro is launched.

As you understood, the **mHelp SDK** depends on the knowledge of UI controls your application contains. It is the reason why in 2012 the **SDK** has been updated to extract all the management of these controls, from the **mHelp** DLL to external DLLs.
