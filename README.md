# [mHelp (DynHelp)](https://github.com/STUDIO-Artaban/mHelp)
-------------
**mHelp** is a Windows **SDK** that easily includes a dynamic help and a scalable macros system to your applications.

This project, previously called **DynHelp SDK**, started during the 1999 year and is based on a simple concept: everything a user can do on the UI of an application can be done programmatically.

This **SDK** comes in the form of a DLL that exports two common functions:

* **mHelpInit**<br>
Called when the main window of your application is activated.
* **mHelpOpen**<br>
Called at a menu or button activation from the main window of your application to open the **mHelp** window.
